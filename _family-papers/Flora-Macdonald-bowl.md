This bowl was accompanied by a note, now lost, written by the Reverend Douglas Gordon Barron (1854-1947), grandson of John Adie and Mary Ann Westile. The note read:

>China bowl which belonged to Flora MacDonald, and was given by her niece, also named Flora, to my Grandmother, wife of John Adie, Surgeon RN when resident in Rothsay in 1807.  DGB

This bowl, cracked and repaired, remains in the family's possession.
