{: .notice}

St Katherine Coleman church was located near the Tower of London, only a few streets away from the docks.  See [Wikipedia article on St Katherine Coleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Katherine_Coleman).

In England, under the provisions of an Act of 1753, a marriage was only legally valid if the banns had been called or a marriage licence had been obtained.  The banns were required to be read aloud on three Sundays before the wedding ceremony, in the home parish churches of both parties.

In this case, both parties are listed as being “of this parish”.  Presumably John and Mary Ann would have to be resident in the parish for the three preceding Sundays.

25 April 1803 was a Monday, so presumably the banns would have been read on 10, 17 and 24 April.  So John and Mary Ann were in all likelihood resident in the parish on or before 10 April 1803, which was Easter Sunday.
