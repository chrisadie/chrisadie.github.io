excerpt: A prayer book containg the names and dates of John Adie's children.
---

An edition of “The Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church according to the use of the United Church of England and Ireland, together with the psalter or Psalms of David, printed as they are to be sung or said in churches”,  dated 1801. This book is in my posession, not in the Shetland Archives.

The book was evidently owned by John Adie (Surgeon, RN), and he has written in it the names and dates of birth of his eleven children:
