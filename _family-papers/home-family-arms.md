title: Coat of arms of the Home family
excerpt: A card showing the Home coat of arms, signed by John Adie.
---

This is a card (roughly postcard-sized) with an armorial painting. On the reverse is written "Coat of Arms of my mother's family. J Adie" in the handwriting of John Adie (son of Janet Sanders, who was the daughter of Janet Home). The motto under the shield, “Usque ad finem fideles” translates to “Faithful even to the end”. The arms appear to be those of the Home family, without the central shield motif which distinguishes the Earls of Home. Note that this item is in my posession, not in the Shetland Archives.
