title: A Home family tree
excerpt: A document showing John Adie's Home ancestors.

This is a carefully-prepared family tree diagram, not in John Adie's writing, though certainly commissioned by him. I have images only of the right-hand side of the diagram, but I have transcribed the main genealogical information from the entire sheet.

## Dating the document

Ann Sanders died 8 February 1825 (according to Scotland’s People), and the document states she is dead, so it must post-date Feb 1825.

It is reasonable to suppose that it is of a similar date to the Account of Home Buchan family, which puts it no later than 1833.

## Kello

Kello (later spelled Kelloe) is just east of Duns in the Scottish borders, on the Blackadder river. To the east lies Blackadder House, to the west is Manderston, to the south-west, further up the river, is Kimmerghame House. All these estates were once owned by Home family members.

## Lands and rents

The document states:

> [Jean Home] got her father’s extensive property adjudged from her brother David and nephew Peter Campbell [Home], in which was comprended 96 Merks land in the Fair Isle, 96 Do in the room of  Quandale, 66 Do in Hillwell, 88 Do in Garth &c and Island of Moussay, Holms called Colsay & all lying within parochines of Dunrossness, Sandwick, Cunningsburgh & sicklike &c and in like manner the hail parsonage and vicarage Tiends of said parochines together with the Umboth Tiends of said Parochines also umboth Duty of Walls, Sandness, Foula and Papa and Umboth Tiends thereto belonging.

So the document implies that David Home of Kello was the “Titular” (ie secular owner) of various tiends, as well as proprietor of the other lands described.
Hillwell is a hamlet just north of Quendale. Colsay is an island just off Spiggie. Garth is likely the Garth in Dunrossness mentioned in the Shetland photo archive - but I can’t find just where that is.
A Merk of land could range from three-quarters of an acre to 14 acres, depending on the productivity of the soil.
“Room” refers to the cultivated land surrounding a township (according to the 1795 Statistical Account quoted in the [Scottish National Dictionary under Room (7))](https://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/room_n1_adj_v).

## Umboth tiends

Definition of tiend (or teind) in the [Scottish National Dictionary](https://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/teind_n1_v1):

> Now gen. in pl. in Sc. Church Law: the tenth part of the produce of land or industry set apart by the state for the support of religion according to the Mosaic Law (Leviticus xxvii. 30), a tithe; now, in Scot., a tax or levy on land, gen. with respect to individual parishes, standardized by the Act of 1925, payable by the owner to the Church of Scotland, as the established Church, and transferred to the parish minister as part of his stipend. After the Reformation, the teinds were annexed to the Crown by James VI and granted to various secular owners, called Titulars or Lords of Erection, subject only to a competent provision for the clergy. By various subsequent enactments the claims were restricted to grain crops, regularised in amount by valuation with provision for augmentation and commutation, and, from 1808, made payable in cash only (see also combs. below). The teind duty was freq. transferred from the landowner to his tenant as an extra charge to his rent. Hence adj. teindable, of land; liable for payment of teinds. Gen.Sc.

Definition of umboth in the [Scottish National Dictionary](https://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/umboth):

> Used attrib. in umboth duty (Sh. 1716 P.S.A.S. XIX. 235), -land, -teind, -tythe, in reference to the lands belonging orig. to the Bishops of Orkney in Shetland and the teinds or tithes payable out of these which were shared equally by the Bishop and the parochial clergyman. When the Bishop's lands were alienated to the Crown and finally to the Earldom of Zetland, the umboth payments were sim. transferred.

Usages quoted in the dictionary suggest that the overall tiend was divided in two - one half being for the minister, the second “umboth” tiend being for the bishop. This was sometimes implemented by every second year’s tiend being umboth.
