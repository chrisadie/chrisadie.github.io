Back in the late 1980s, I adapted C-Kermit to run on OS/2.

Let me unpack that a little. [Kermit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_(protocol)) was a file transfer and communications protocol used between a desktop computer such as the [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer) and a minicomputer or mainframe. It usually ran over a serial communications interface, often [RS-232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232). [C-Kermit](https://www.kermitproject.org/) was (and is) an open-source implementation of that functionality, written in C, running on a whole range of different operating systems - but at that time, not OS/2. [OS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2) was an operating system released by IBM for a new range of personal computer systems, intended to replace [IBM PC DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_DOS).

My contribution was to port  C-Kermit to OS/2, and to provide a [VT220](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT220) terminal emulation capability. I downloaded the C-Kermit source code recently, and my name is still in there, though I didn't recognise the code - partly because I have forgotten what it looks like, partly because I'm sure it has been refactored so many times as to be unrecognisable.

What happened to all this technology? Well, OS/2 failed because it could not compete against Microsoft Windows. RS-232 still exists in niche applications, but has largely been replaced by USB and IP over Ethernet and Wifi. C-Kermit has been replaced by applications such as [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) and [SAMBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)), but it still exists - you can download it and play, if you have time to spare.
