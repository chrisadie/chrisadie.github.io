If I have any claim to fame, it is that back in 1995 I coded the first web server for Windows NT.

I was working in the Computing Services department at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). It was around 1994, in the early days of [Windows NT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT). We had received funding from Microsoft to set up something called the European Microsoft Windows Academic Centre (EMWAC), tasked with encouraging the takeup of Windows NT in the academic community. Part of the job was to deliver software which academics would find useful, and I was tasked with implementing Gopher, WAIS and World Wide Web servers.

The [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)) server turned out to be pretty easy to do. The [WAIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_information_server) server never really worked.

The EMWAC web server, however, was spectacularly successful. It went through several iterations, and was widely used during the mid nineties. It hosted the very first BBC website, and the very first Microsoft website.

The code was never open source. The University retained the IPR, and I enhanced the code to produce a "professional" version with additional features. That version was licensed to a company called [Process Software](https://www.process.com/), based in Framingham, Massachusetts, who marketed it under the name "Purveyor". This was in the days when software was something you purchased in a shop or by mail order, and it came on a CD in a box with a massive manual. Purveyor sold well for a while, but soon Microsoft realised that they needed their own web server code, and produced [IIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services), which came free with Windows. This immediately killed Purveyor.

There's an [post on the Socket 3 blog](https://socket3.wordpress.com/2018/07/05/serving-the-web-with-emwac/) which talks about the old EMWAC web server in more detail, and provides links to the executables. No-one uses it now, of course. RIP.
