As part of the [EMWAC project](/blog/EMWAC/) I was tasked in the mid-1990s with coding a mail server for Windows NT, called IMS (for "Internet Mail Server").
An enhanced version of IMS was licensed to companies in the UK, the US, Canada and Japan.

One licensee, [Rockliffe Systems Inc](https://www.rockliffe.com/) based in Silicon Valley, commissioned my team to maintain and enhance the software. Our relationship with Rockliffe lasted several years, to around 2003 or so. I was for a while Rockliffe's (part-time, honorary!) Vice President of Research and Development. The Rockliffe version of the email server is still actively sold and developed under the name [Mailsite](https://mailsite.com/).
