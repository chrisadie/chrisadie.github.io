From 1977 to 1980 I studied at the [Unversity of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) for a PhD in physics. It was largely experimental research, but with some theoretical work as well. My topic was [superfluidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfluidity), and my main memory of that time is of finding and fixing leaks in vacuum equipment, and filling and emptying my cryostat with liquid cryogens _so_ many times!

My supervisors were Jon Armitage and [J F Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Allen_(physicist)), the co-discoverer of superfluidity, once the doyen of the worldwide low temperature physics community, and after whom the physics building at the University is now named.

After leaving the University to work at the University of Edinburgh as a Research Associate, I spent several years analysing my experimental results from St Andrews and writing up my thesis. I was finally awarded my PhD in 1984. If you are interested, here is the link to my theseis, entitled [Dissipation in the superfluid helium film](https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/14602).
